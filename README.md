## **Step by Step for the Correct Use**

The file called Spline\_Json2.py has a program that helps read JSON files.



#### Step 1:

You need to get at least 11 points using the Kinovea software. These points must show the spinal curve of the patient. The photo must be taken from the side view.



#### Step 2:

You must mark the zero point or the start of the coordinate system with the label M0. After that, use the labels M1 to M11, in order.

## Step 3:

Then, export the file in JSON format and save it in a folder on your computer.



## Step 4:

Now, open the code in a program like Visual Studio Code. Run the program and select at least 1 JSON file. It is better to name the file with the patient’s name.



The program will show each spinal curve on the screen.
